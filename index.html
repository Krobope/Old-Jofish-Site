                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm glad you decided to check out my website :)</p>
                    <p>My name is Joseph (online as jofish) and I'm an ameteur developer, lover of old technology, retro games, Computer Engineering major, and INSTAGRAM REELS</p>
                    <p>I've loved computers for literally my entire life, and have been dabbling in programming of some kind since elementary school, albeit it was mostly scratch. Realistically, though, I have been programming for about 3 years and am mainly proficient in Java; however, I also have some experience in C#. I know about enough HTML/CSS to develop this page but am certainly no web developer. I'm certified in Unity but have switched to Godot and am currently learning it.</p>
                    <p>During my high school years, I worked as an IT intern so I have some experience in laptop repair/general tech support, but I wouldn't call myself an expert my any means.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of which, I've been collecting videos games since about when I was born as well! It started with V-Smile and later into old Nintendo and Playstation. Now I do a bit of everything. I think in middle school is when I turned this hobby into a business where I buy and resell games, I sell at conventions, sidewalk sales, my garage sales, and ebay. I have so. many. games.</p>
