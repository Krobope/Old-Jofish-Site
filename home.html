                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Joseph and I am a ameteur developer and IT guy. I mainly develop games but have tried my hand at web design (obviously, since you're on this page!). I enjoy programming challenges and especially like to develop in unconvential ways.</p>
                    <p>I've loved computers for literally my entire life, and have been dabbling in programming of some kind since elementary school, albeit it was mostly scratch. Realistically, though, I have been programming for about 3 years and am mainly proficient in Java; however, I also have some experience in C# and Python. I know about enough HTML/CSS to develop this page but am certainly no web developer. </p>
                    <p>The last two years I have worked as an IT Intern at my highschool. I mostly fix chromebooks -- but I occasionally get to do some actual IT work in a teacher's classroom. In my free time, I like to repair and/or mod consoles I get from my business.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of which, I've been collecting videos games since about when I was born as well! It started with V-Smiel and later into old nintendo and playstation. Now I do a bit of everything. I think in middle school is when I turned this hobby into a business where I resell games at sidewalk sales, conventions, and recently, ebay. I have so. many. games.</p>
